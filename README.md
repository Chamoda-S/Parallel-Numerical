# Parallel-Numerical-Integration
A comparative implementation of the Trapezoidal Rule in serial, OpenMP, MPI and CUDA. Demonstrates how numerical integration can be accelerated through parallelism across multicore CPUs, distributed systems and GPUs. Includes performance analysis, code samples and execution instructions.
